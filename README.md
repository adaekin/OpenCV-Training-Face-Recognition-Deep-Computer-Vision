#OpenCV Training â€“ Face Recognition & Deep Computer Vision

This repository contains my self-made training exercises and implementations using OpenCV and deep learning techniques for computer vision tasks.
The main focus of this project is face recognition, covering fundamental and advanced concepts in image processing, detection, and recognition.

#ðŸš€ Features

-Basics of OpenCV image processing

-Face detection using Haar cascades

-Face recognition with deep learning models

-Working with datasets of faces (loading, preprocessing, training)
